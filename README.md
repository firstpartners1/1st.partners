1st Partners: A Direct Advertiser with Tier-1 Focus

In iGaming affiliate marketing, clarity of structure often matters more than promises. 1st Partners has entered the market as a direct advertiser, positioning itself around two elements: ownership of in-house brands and concentration on Tier-1 geographies such as Europe and Canada.

Unlike resellers or white-label solutions, all brands promoted through 1st Partners — including BeonBet, BitStake, SlotRush, and Betsomnia — are operated internally. This setup reduces dependency on third parties and ensures consistency in product quality, conversion tracking, and long-term retention. For affiliates, the value lies in working with products built and maintained by the same entity that manages the affiliate program.

The choice of Tier-1 markets reflects a deliberate strategy. Players in Europe and Canada demonstrate stronger purchasing power, higher deposit averages, and longer activity cycles compared to many emerging geos. Regulatory clarity and stable digital infrastructure add further security, enabling campaigns that scale without frequent disruptions.

Financial conditions are straightforward. The program starts with a 40% revenue share and does not apply negative carryover. For affiliates preferring alternative structures, CPA and hybrid agreements are available. A 5% referral commission provides an additional channel of income. Reporting is handled through the Affilka platform, offering hourly updates, API support, and transparent revenue calculations based on Net Gaming Revenue without hidden deductions.

Payment terms reflect a focus on accessibility. Withdrawals begin at €100 via e-wallets or cryptocurrency, while bank transfers are available from €1,000. Payouts are monthly, with crypto and e-wallets processed by the 15th and wire transfers by the 21st. Supported methods include Skrill, Neteller, SEPA, PayPal, and various crypto options, allowing affiliates to manage cash flow according to their operational needs.

Another element frequently mentioned by affiliates is support. Account managers are noted for their responsiveness and practical involvement, providing optimization advice, feedback on campaigns, and flexibility in terms where justified by performance. This approach reflects the direct advertiser model: when affiliates grow, the brands benefit accordingly.

Industry perception has followed suit. Reviews on professional platforms highlight timely payments, clear contractual terms, and the consistency of program management. By openly identifying as a direct advertiser with independent infrastructure, 1st Partners has positioned itself as a stable option in a field where reliability is not always guaranteed.

For affiliates aiming at Tier-1 geographies, the proposition is defined: direct cooperation with brand owners, transparent terms, and infrastructure built for scale. 1st Partners offers a structure where affiliates can operate with predictable conditions and focus on performance without unnecessary intermediaries.
